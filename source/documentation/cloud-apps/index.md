# Getting Started

This doc will cover the steps you need to take to create a cloud app and make it
available to the masses to install in their Spiceworks environment. We'll use an
actual example to show you how to create a cloud app along the way.

## Installing Spiceworks

Before starting to build your cloud app, you first need to install the
[Spiceworks Desktop: Developer
Edition][Download DE].
The Spiceworks Desktop is where users will ultimately be installing and loading
your cloud app.  The developer edition of the Spiceworks Desktop has some small
admin features that make it easier to build and test your cloud app during
development, before it's been published to the Spiceworks App Center.

Like the IT-pro version of the Spiceworks Desktop, the developer edition will
need to be installed in a Windows environment (Note: We are currently working on
development tools that avoid this requirement).

## Create a place for your app to live

Once you've installed Spiceworks, we'll need to find a home for your app. A
Spiceworks app is just a website, so make sure that your web app is being served
somewhere so that it can be accessed by Spiceworks.  This means that you must
have a local or a remote web server serving your web application so that it can
be loaded within Spiceworks. At this point, you can just create a framework for
the app. You'll just need a host URL to get the app creation process started
within Spiceworks.

### Example
In this example, we create a single-page application in a Github Gist. If you're
not familiar with Github, it basically just gives you a place to store code. You
can then use sites like http://bl.ocks.org to then render that code in a usable
format for Spiceworks.

1) Go to <https://gist.github.com> to create a Gist. It will ask you if you want to
save the Gist as "secret" or "public". Either one works just fine. We can create
the framework for the ubiquitous "Hello world!" application like so:

``` html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
    <body>
     <h3>Hello world!</h3>
    </body>
   </html>
```
2) Save the Gist file as **index.html**.

3) Make sure that your Gist is working properly by testing it in a browser using
<http://bl.ocks.org>. So the Gist I created on Github (at
<https://gist.github.com/babbtx/dab075639fef532d612a>) can be tested by viewing
it at <http://bl.ocks.org/babbtx/raw/dab075639fef532d612a/>. The bl.ocks.org URL
is built using your Github username, the keyword "raw", and the Gist SHA.
(**Note:** The http://bl.ocks.org site caches the page for several minutes, so
changes you make to the source may not be immediately reflected in the
application.

## Create & register your web app with Spiceworks

After you have Spiceworks Developer Edition installed and your web app running,
you need to create and register your web app inside of Spiceworks. You can do
this by following these steps:

1) Click the Spiceworks logo at the top. This takes you to the management screen
for installed apps. Create a new app by clicking **New App &rarr; New Platform
App**.

2) Fill in your app's basic info. The App Name field will be what is displayed in
the app center, and the Namespace is what will be listed in the url for your app
in the Spiceworks App Center. So in our example, the App Name would be Hello
World! and the Namespace could be hello-world.

3) Now you'll need to let Spiceworks know where to pull the app from and display
it. You'll want to enter your App Host URL, which is the location of your web
app's landing page, as a Full Page App Placement. In our example, this would be
http://bl.ocks.org/babbtx/raw/dab075639fef532d612a/. Our example application
does not have any pages to be placed specifically upon tickets or devices,
therefore we will leave those options disabled.

4) Set any permissions your app will require. If you're planning on pulling any
info from the IT pros' Spiceworks installations to display in your app or to
dictate what is displayed, you'll need to indicate that here. Our example
application is going to use the Inventory service. Click the toggle to choose
this permission.

5) Click **Save** to make your app available in your Spiceworks Developer Edition install.

## Add javascript to your application to get data from Spiceworks
Now that you have registered your application, you can add some Javascript to
display help desk and/or inventory data retrieved from Spiceworks.

1) **Include Spiceworks SDK:** Minimally, you'll want to include the Spiceworks
SDK javascript. For our "Hello world!" example, we're including jQuery as well.

``` html
   <head>
    <script src="https://spiceworks.github.io/spiceworks-js-sdk/dist/spiceworks-sdk.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
   </head>
```

2) **Request service:** Services give you access to the data inside Spiceworks.
You can find details of the services available here: [Help
Desk](https://github.com/spiceworks/spiceworks-js-sdk/blob/master/docs/apis/helpdesk.md)
and
[Inventory](https://github.com/spiceworks/spiceworks-js-sdk/blob/master/docs/apis/inventory.md).
Here's what we're using in our example:

``` javascript
   <script type="text/javascript">
    $(document).ready(function(){
     var card = new SW.Card();
     var inventory = card.services('inventory');
    });
   </script>
```

3) **Request data:** A data request returns a Javascript Promise, which, when
resolved, provides you with the data you requested.

``` javascript
   inventory.request('devices').then(function(data){
    /* do something */ });
```

4) **Format the data accordingly:** Now you'll need to make the data presentable
(yes, there are much better ways to format the data into HTML DOM, but bear with
me for the purposes of this example).

``` javascript
   inventory.request('devices').then(function(data){
    $.each(data.devices, function(index, device){
     $('body').append('<p>' + device.name);
    });
   });
```

### Example
At this point, our example app looks like this:

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
  <script src="https://spiceworks.github.io/spiceworks-js-sdk/dist/spiceworks-sdk.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">
   $(document).ready(function(){
     var card = new SW.Card();
     var inventory = card.services('inventory');
     inventory.request('devices').then(function(data){
       $.each(data.devices, function(index, device){
         $('body').append('<p>' + device.name);
       });
     });
   });
  </script>
 </head>
 <body>
  <h3>Hello world!</h3>
 </body>
</html>
```

5) **Reload your application and check the results!** Now if you reload your
application at /apps/hello-world in your Spiceworks Developer Edition server,
you will see Hello World! and a list of device names.
