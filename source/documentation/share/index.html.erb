    <p>SpiceButtons are Spiceworks’ version of simple, embeddable social media buttons… specifically meant for IT. Just grab a line or two of code and you’re off and running… social IT style.</p>

      Follow
    </h2>
    <%= image_tag 'documentation/follow.png', alt: 'Spiceworks Follow SpiceButton', class: 'screenshot' %>
    <p>Wanna make sure IT pros to engage with you, where they work, when they're working?</p>
    <p>Use the 'Follow' social button to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Have IT pros follow your Spiceworks Vendor Page with one click</li>
      <li>Stream posts from your Vendor Page to their Activity Stream</li>
      <li>Have some fun—IT doesn’t have to be boring!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Kids love to play games… none more universal than “Follow the Leader.” IT pros were kids at one time (and many still are at heart), so bring back the joy of youth and let them Follow you.</p>
    <p>Follow is a simple way for IT pros to learn more about your business… where and when they work. When IT pros follow your Vendor Page, content from your page will stream to their Activity Feed. As these IT pros engage with your Page, their social connections are notified, and can draw new followers.</p>

        <li>Grab the code and put it on your IT website</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Baam! That's IT.</p>
