As IT pros have known for years, Spiceworks is the place to go for IT product
research.  We have over 236,150 customer reviews on over 41,420 products in 280
different categories!  It's a wealth of information that can only be found on
Spiceworks, and it's growing day by day.

Wouldn't it be cool if you could easily put these product ratings and reviews on
your own website?  With Spiceworks Ratings and Reviews Syndication, you can -
for free!  All you need is one little code snippet to add a Spiceworks badge to
your product site.  When a user clicks on the badge, a relevant product review
pops up right there, with links to even more reviews of the product on
Spiceworks.

Spiceworks Ratings and Reviews Syndication puts you in the driver's seat.  You
pick the products you want to feature, and you choose where these badges appear
on your site. Ready to get started? [Click here](http://community.spiceworks.com/vendor_key/demo/developer)

syndication that can populate your website with even more product reviews as
well as relevant usage information.  With this for-fee offering, the same

well as graphs on product usage trends such as industry and network size.

In addition, we offer a premium syndication product that provides a standalone
webpage you can publish anywhere you like, including on channel partner
websites.  You can use this syndication page to showcase multiple products and
provide readers with comprehensive product reviews and usage information.
