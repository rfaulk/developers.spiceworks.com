<li>Don’t include keyword lists, excessive punctuation, or non-standard symbols. </li>
</ol></li>
<li>All Images:

<ol>
<li>Use high quality, relevant images that reflect the app experience.</li>
<li>Comply with our Spiceworks Brand Guidelines and Community Standards. </li>
<li>Don&#39;t use pixelated, stretched, or distorted images.</li>
<li>Keep any text concise. Don&#39;t obstruct the images. </li>

</ol></li>
<li>Icons:

<ol>
<li>Keep icons simple and free of visual clutter. </li>
<li>Use a transparent or colored background. If your icon requires a white background, use a colored border. </li>
</ol></li>
<li>Do not use irrelevant, misleading, or excessive keywords in app descriptions, titles, or metadata.</li>
<li>Do not attempt to change the placement of any app in the App Center or manipulate any App ratings or reviews by unauthorized means, such as fraudulent installs, paid or fake reviews or ratings, or offering incentives to rate App.</li>
<li>Free should mean free.  If you offer your app for free, do not later try to charge users for it.  We encourage free trials, so long as it is clear to the user upfront. </li>
<li>You will be responsible for uploading your app to the Spiceworks App Center, providing required app information to users, and accurately disclosing the security permissions necessary for the app to function. Apps that are not properly uploaded will not be published in the Spiceworks App Center.</li>

<li>Spiceworks may limit the number of apps you or your company may publish to the App Center.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="10.-payments-&amp;-revenue-share">10. Payments &amp; Revenue Share</h3>

<ol>
<li>Currently, we do not charge developers to offer their apps in the Spiceworks App Center.  However, in the future, we will charge developers a fee equal to a 30 percentage of the revenue generated by a developer’s app.  This fee would likely cover revenue generated as a result of the sale of apps or in app purchases.  If we do start charging this fee, we will give you notice ahead of time, explain how the fees will work and you can decide if you would like your app to remain in the Spiceworks App Center.<br></li>
<li>When we allow the purchase of apps and in-app purchasing, you must use the Spiceworks App Center purchase system to charge for your app and in app purchases.<br></li>
<li>In the event your pricing model is not supported by the Spiceworks App Center purchase system at the time you apply to the Spiceworks App Center, you may notify us and transact the payments through your own payment system.  This is only available if the pricing model offered in the Spiceworks App Center is consistent with your other pricing modes and we will require you to provide monthly accounting of all transactions related to the Spiceworks App Center.  If we start to support your pricing model, you will be required to convert to our payment system. </li>
<li>You will give us a 30 day notice if you change your pricing/licensing model (e.g., increase rate or change licensing terms).</li>
<li>Whenever you complete a sales transaction, we will credit the proceeds from that sale, less our fees, to your balance.  If your transaction was in a currency other than US Dollars, proceeds from the sale will be converted at the time of the transaction according to that day’s published exchange rate.</li>
<li>We will payout your balance according to the following rules:

<ol>
<li>We will payout once per month.</li>
<li>Your current banking information and any other information we need to make the payment on record, including if required, identification and tax and business formation documentation.</li>
<li>We will payout if your balance for any given pay period is greater than or equal to $100 US Dollars.  If your balance is less than $100, we will roll payment over to the next month, unless your account is being deactivated or deleted, or if it has been one year since either your last redemption payment or the submission of your app.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="11.-termination">11. Termination</h3>

<ol>
<li>You can decide at any time that you no longer wish for your App to be in the Spiceworks App Center.  You must notify us <a href="mailto:spiceworksappcenter@spiceworks.com">spiceworksappcenter@spiceworks.com</a> and we will work with you to remove your app.<br></li>
<li>If you violate and of these terms or if we determine that your app can no longer be a part of the Spiceworks App Center, then we may terminate our relationship with you with respect to your app and no longer offer your app on the Spiceworks App Center.  If that happens we will try to give you as much notice as practicable.<br></li>
<li>Whatever the reason, if your app is no longer going to be a part of the Spiceworks App Center, then you must contact all users of your app, give them fair warning and describe how you will support them going forward.</li>
<li>Section 5 and all other Spiceworks terms applicable to your use of the Spiceworks App Center that, by their nature, are intended to survive, will survive even if our relationship with you with respect to your app is terminated.<br></li>
