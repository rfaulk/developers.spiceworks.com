<ol>
<li> <strong>License to You.</strong> Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Spiceworks grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and worldwide license during the Term of this Agreement to (a) use the object code libraries, APIs and documentation specified in the SDK solely to enable your Applications to access the Spiceworks Platform; and (b) modify any sample code included within the SDK solely as necessary to develop your Applications.</li>

This section and Sections 2.2 - 2.4, 3, 6-7, and 9-13 will survive termination of the Agreement.</li>
</ol></li>
<li> <strong>Confidentiality.</strong>

<ol>
<li> <strong>General Obligation.</strong> You, as a recipient of Confidential Information, will (a) hold the Confidential Information in strict confidence; (b) protect and safeguard the confidentiality of the Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as you protect and safeguard your own confidential and proprietary information (but in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care); (c) immediately notify Spiceworks of any unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of any of Confidential Information; and (d) cooperate with Spiceworks’ efforts to prevent further breaches of the Agreement.</li>
<li> <strong>Disclosure to Representatives.</strong> In addition to the obligations in Section 9.1, the receiving party will only disclose or disseminate the disclosing party’s Confidential Information to its employees and contractors (<strong><em>“Representatives”</em></strong>) who have a need to know and who have signed written agreements with (or are otherwise bound by confidentiality obligations owed to) the receiving party that require or permit such individuals to use, disclose, and protect the disclosing party’s Confidential Information only in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Agreement. The receiving party will be liable to the disclosing party for any failure by any Representatives to comply with obligations set forth in the Agreement.</li>
<li> <strong>Press Releases.</strong> You may not issue any press releases or make any other public statements about the Agreement without Spiceworks’ prior written approval.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Disclaimer of Warranties.</strong> SPICEWORKS IS PROVIDING YOU WITH THE SDK AND ACCESS TO THE SPICEWORKS PLATFORM <strong><em>“AS IS”</em></strong> WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, AND YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SPICEWORKS AND ITS LICENSORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING ACCURACY, OPERABILITY, USE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</li>
<li><strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO INDEMNIFICATION AND CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS, AND TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND/OR SUCH DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY LOSS OF REVENUE OR ANTICIPATED PROFITS OR LOST BUSINESS. IN NO EVENT WILL SPICEWORKS’ LIABILITY TO YOU ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE AGREEMENT EXCEED $50.00.</li>
<li><strong>Indemnification.</strong> To the greatest extent permitted by law, you will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Spiceworks and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all third party claims, demands, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs) arising out of or related to: (a) your use of the SDK; (b) any third party’s use of your Applications; and (c) your breach of the Agreement or any failure by any of your affiliates to comply with any of the terms and conditions of the Agreement. Spiceworks will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with prompt notification of any claim for which Spiceworks seeks an indemnity, but Spiceworks’ failure to provide such prompt notice will not limit your obligation to indemnify Spiceworks unless you have been materially harmed by such failure of prompt notice. Spiceworks will cooperate in your defense of any claim, at your sole expense. You may not settle any claim against Spiceworks in a manner that adversely affects Spiceworks without Spiceworks’ prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Spiceworks may participate in the defense of a claim through counsel of its own choice at its own expense; provided, however, that if Spiceworks reasonably determines that you are unwilling or unable to defend the interests of Spiceworks, then Spiceworks may assume the defense against any claims at your expense. Spiceworks will not settle any claim for which you are obligated to indemnify Spiceworks without your prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).</li>
<li><strong>General Legal Terms.</strong>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Assignments.</strong> You may not assign or transfer the Agreement (or any of your rights or obligations under the Agreement) without (a) Spiceworks’ prior written consent, and (b) where consent has been granted, by ensuring that any assignee or transferee agrees to be bound by the Agreement in the same manner as you (including with respect to any intellectual property rights). Any attempted assignment or transfer without complying with the preceding sentence will be void. Spiceworks may freely assign or transfer the Agreement. The Agreement inures to the benefit of and is binding upon the parties and their respective legal representatives, successors, and permitted assigns.</li>
<li> <strong>Authority.</strong> If you are using the SDK on behalf of your employer or for your employer’s products, you represent, warrant, and covenant that you have the right, power, and authority to enter into the Agreement on behalf of your employer.</li>
<li> <strong>Electronic Communications.</strong> You consent to receive communications from Spiceworks electronically. Spiceworks will communicate with you by email, and you acknowledge that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Spiceworks provides to you electronically will satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.</li>
<li> <strong>Entire Agreement; Amendments.</strong> The Agreement supersedes all prior discussions and writings regarding and constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the SDK. The parties may only amend the Agreement in writing.</li>
<li> <strong>Export.</strong> You will not (whether directly or indirectly) export or re-export the SDK to: (a) any countries that are subject to US export restrictions (such as, by way of example and not limitation, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria); (b) any third party who will utilize the SDK for prohibited end uses (such as, by way of example and not limitation, for the design, development or production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons); or (c) any third party who has been prohibited from participating in U.S. export transactions by any federal agency of the U.S. government (such as someone on the U.S. Treasury Department&#39;s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons List or Entity List).</li>
<li> <strong>Governing Law and Venue.</strong> The Agreement is to be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of Texas, excluding its conflict of law principles. You and Spiceworks will: (a) bring any disputes arising out of or related to the Agreement exclusively in a state or federal court located in Travis County, Texas; and (b) submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</li>
<li> <strong>Government End Users.</strong> The SDK and any associated documentation are <strong><em>“Commercial Items,”</em></strong> as such term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §2.101, consisting of <strong><em>“Commercial Computer Software”</em></strong> and <strong><em>“Commercial Computer Software Documentation,”</em></strong> as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202 (as applicable). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (as applicable), the Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation are being licensed to U.S. Government end-users only (a) as Commercial Items, and (b) with those rights that are granted to all other end-users under the Agreement.</li>
<li> <strong>Irreparable Harm.</strong> You agree that any actual or threatened breach of the Agreement by you would cause immediate and irreparable harm to Spiceworks, the value of which would be difficult or impossible to determine and for which monetary damages would be inadequate compensation. Accordingly, in addition to any other remedies (and notwithstanding Section 13.6), Spiceworks will be entitled to obtain injunctive relief and/or specific performance from any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any such breaches and you expressly waive: (a) the defense that monetary damages would be adequate compensation for Spiceworks; (b) the defense that the harm to you and/or to others would outweigh the harm to Spiceworks; and (c) any requirement that Spiceworks post a bond or other security.</li>
<li> <strong>Notices.</strong> To be valid, all notices permitted or required under the Agreement must be sent in writing by a party as follows (unless a party changes such information by giving notice in accordance with this section): (a) if to you, by Spiceworks via email to the address associated with your developer account, and (b) if to Spiceworks, by you via certified mail to Spiceworks, Inc., 7300 FM 2222, Bldg. III, Suite 100, Austin, Texas  78730, attn.: Legal Department. Notices will be deemed given (i) if to you, when emailed, and (ii) if to Spiceworks, on receipt by Spiceworks.</li>
<li><strong>Relationship.</strong> The Agreement does not confer any third party beneficiary rights (except as set forth in Section 12) and does not create a joint venture, agency, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise between the parties. Except as expressly provided herein, neither party has the right, power, or authority to create any obligation or duty, express or implied, on behalf of the other. Except as set forth in Section 12, there are no intended third party beneficiaries of the Agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Severability, Waiver, and Interpretation.</strong> If any provision of the Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, such unenforceability or invalidity will not render the Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole and, in such event, such provision is to be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of applicable law. No waiver of any breach of the Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other breach. In construing or interpreting the terms of the Agreement: (a) the headings in the Agreement are for convenience only, and are not to be considered, and (b) no presumption is to operate in either party’s favor as a result of its counsel’s role in drafting the Agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Representation by Counsel.</strong> You represent that you have had the opportunity to review the Agreement with legal counsel of your choosing prior to entering into the Agreement even if you have chosen not to seek such counsel.</li>
