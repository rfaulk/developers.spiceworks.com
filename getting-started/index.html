      <p>Get started extending Spiceworks with a breakthrough plugin, report or cloud integration.</p>

      <h2 id="whats-an-app">What exactly is an app in Spiceworks?</h2>
      <p>
        Apps are made up of a collection of web pages called cards. A card is a
        blank canvas that appears in a specific location inside of the
        Spiceworks application, where your app can display content. Every app
        created for Spiceworks must have a full-page card, but can also have
        smaller cards that display in certain parts of the app, or live in the
        footer. Spiceworks’ primary navigation contains links to the full-page
        card of each installed app.
      </p>

      <h2 id="what-can-you-make">What kinds of apps can you make?</h2>
      <p>
        There are two types of apps in Spiceworks: <strong>plugins</strong>
        &amp; <strong>platform apps</strong>.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Plugins</strong> have been part of Spiceworks for a long
            time now.  SpiceHeads (what Spiceworks users have come to call
            themselves) have been using plugins to modify the look and feel of
            Spiceworks to meet their needs.  Plugins are external snippets of
            JavaScript code that plug in to Spiceworks and can utilize jQuery to
            help make things even easier for you. A plugin pretty much lives
            within the context of the user’s browser and there is very little
            code that executes on the backend servers, outside of a few of the
            provided Spiceworks APIs. Spiceworks has events that will load the
            plugins on top of the page, after the page loads.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Platform Apps</strong> are externally hosted web pages that
            are embedded into the Spiceworks Application using an
            iframe.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        With Platform Apps you can create almost any type of app you can dream
        up.  You can build:

        <ul>
          <li>
            On our <em>inventory services</em>, which provide access to the
            network devices and asset inventory managed within Spiceworks.
            Inventory includes devices and software.
          </li>
          <li>
            On our <em>help desk services</em>, which allow you to list existing
            help desk tickets, show a specific ticket, and create new tickets.
          </li>
          <li>
            On our <em>environmental services</em>, which provide information
            about the host environment and the current user.
          </li>
          <li> Something <em>new</em> that adds value to an IT pro’s day.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2 id="integrating-with-spiceworks">How will I integrate my platform app with Spiceworks?</h2>
      <p>
        Your platform application (app) will be an externally-hosted web page
        that’s embedded into the desktop of the Spiceworks application using an
        iframe. Apps can exist as a full page, but can also appear in multiple
        other positions throughout the Spiceworks desktop, such as in the body
        of a ticket. If your app needs to share data with the Spiceworks Desktop
        or respond to Spiceworks Desktop events, you can communicate with it
        using our new set of APIs. The apps you create will be available for
        user download from the Spiceworks App Center. <a
        href="http://developers.spiceworks.com/downloads"
        target="_blank">Download the SDE</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="spiceworks-dev-edition">Meet the Spiceworks Developer Edition (SDE).</h2>
      <p>
        The SDE is a version of the Spiceworks desktop application that includes
        a sample database and other features to help you build and test
        applications inside of an almost real, working version of Spiceworks.
        It’s meant as a way for you to be able to test your app against
        real-world data without having to create a network full of devices on
        your own. It’s also customized to make it easier for you to be able to
        list your app in the Spiceworks App Center.
      </p>

      <h2 id="spiceworks-app-center">More on the Spiceworks App Center</h2>
      <p>
        How did the App Center come about? Even before SDE became available,
        developers were creating plugins, language packs, scripts, and reports
        to help IT pros get the most out of Spiceworks. These resources got
        vetted and voted on by SpiceHeads (what Spiceworks users have come to
        call themselves) and then became available for other SpiceHeads to
        download from the App Center. Any apps you create using the SDE will
        also find their home in the App Center, which currently contains:

        <ul>
          <li>Over 3,000 reports</li>
          <li>
            Over 300 plugins (including vendor integrations that bring
            third-party functionality directly into the Spiceworks dashboard)
          </li>
          <li>
            Nearly 500 language packs created by native speakers around the
            world
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2 id="our-audience">Tap directly into your audience’s app wish lists</h2>
      <p>
        Much like developers in the past tapped into the Spiceworks Community to
        find out what IT pros need, you can also use the Spiceworks Community to
        give you an idea of what sort of applications SpiceHeads love and use,
        as well as to gauge their reaction to your app and get feedback on
        specific feature requests or your app ideas. Just join the community,
        set up your profile, and start checking out everything from feature
        requests to popular discussions. You can even meet face-to-face to get
        feedback from your app audience: SpiceCorps are Spiceworks user groups
        that meet in person around the world and give you a chance to mingle in
        person with the IT pros who use Spiceworks every day.

      <h2 id="why-spiceworks">Why develop apps for Spiceworks?</h2>
      <p>What makes Spiceworks different than other platforms?

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>REACH:</strong> Building an app on the Spiceworks platform
            gives you a chance to integrate into the daily workflow of the
            world’s largest community of IT pros.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>TRUST:</strong> You’re not unknown to the IT pro when build
            an app for Spiceworks – you’re part of a community that they already
            know and trust to deliver value in their IT day.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>INSTANT DATA:</strong> By incorporating our inventory data,
            you can reduce one of the biggest hurdles to trying new apps – the
            configuration step.  The Spiceworks application already knows about
            the IT pro’s environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AUTOMATIC UPDATES:</strong> Updates to your app get to all
            users instantaneously.  Since your app is in the cloud, when you
            make changes or add functionality, all the users of your app get the
            new functionality right away.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>$$$ POTENTIAL:</strong>  Unlike other app marketplaces where
            you’re competing with a marketplace jam-packed full of apps, the
            Spiceworks App Center is new and filled with IT pros looking for
            solutions to make their day easier.  This makes the possibility to
            make real money, well, real. Let’s just say, for example, your app
            costs $5 a month or $500 for a year, you would only need to sell 200
            to have an app that generates $100,000 per year. When your app is in
            front of an audience eagerly looking for apps that help them manage
            IT, 200 downloads seems pretty doable.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2 id="market-your-app">How to market your app?</h2>
      <p>Looking for Here are some general marketing tips for your app?

        <ul>
          <li>
            Choose a clear and descriptive informative name – Naming an app in a
            way that clearly defines the problem it solves for an IT pro will
            make them more likely to install it. Helps users that are quickly
            scanning for apps to solve their problems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use high quality images for your icon and screenshots.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the description to spell out the problem you’re solving for the
            IT pro. This is your chance to elaborate on why they need your app.
            Don’t just list features, make sure to tell them the benefits.
          </li>
          <li>
            Include a free trial.  IT pros want to try out apps before they buy.
            They are more likely to consider your app if they can try it out for
            free beforehand.
          </li>
          <li>
            Encourage feedback and reviews on your app.  SpiceHeads trust each
            other.  Gathering feedback from SpiceHeads will help you to not only
            improve your app but also build your and your app’s credibility in
            Spiceworks (which means more downloads).
          </li>
        </ul>
